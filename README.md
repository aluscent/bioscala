## BioScala: A Functional Bioinformatics Library
Welcome to BioScala, a lightweight yet powerful bioinformatics library designed for functional programming enthusiasts and bioinformatics researchers. Built in Scala, BioScala provides immutable, type-safe abstractions for working with DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, alignments, and more.

Whether you're analyzing sequences, performing alignments, or translating DNA to proteins, BioScala offers a clean, modular API to simplify your workflows.

### Why BioScala?
**üß¨ Functional Design:** Immutable data structures and pure functions for reliable, reproducible analysis.

**üß© Modular Architecture:** Plug-and-play modules for sequences, alignments, and attributes.

**üìä Extensible:** Easily add custom functionality or integrate with other tools.

**üî¨ Research-Ready:** Designed with bioinformatics workflows in mind.

### Features
#### Core Functionality

- **DNA/RNA/Protein Sequences:** Immutable, type-safe representations with support for gaps and IUPAC symbols.

- **Sequence Alignment:** Basic pairwise alignment and sparse alignment tools.

- **Transcription & Translation:** Convert DNA to RNA and RNA to protein sequences.

- **Attributes:** Attach metadata (e.g., IDs, descriptions) to sequences and alignments.

#### Current Modules

- **Alignment:** Tools for working with sequence alignments, including sparse alignments.

- **Attribute:** Manage metadata and properties for sequences and alignments.

- **Chemistry:** Represent nucleotides, amino acids, and codons with strong typing.

- **Nucleotide:** Core DNA and RNA sequence handling.

- **Sequence:** High-level abstractions for working with biological sequences.

### Quick Start

#### Installation

Since BioScala is a **work in progress** and not yet published on Maven Central, you‚Äôll need to clone the repository and publish it locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/bioscala/bioscala.git
cd bioscala
```

2. **Publish Locally:**
Use sbt to publish the library to your local Ivy repository:
```bash
Copy
sbt publishLocal
```

3. **Add to Your Project:**
Add the dependency to your `build.sbt`:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.bioscala" %% "bioscala-core" % "0.2.0"
```

#### Example: DNA to RNA Transcription
```scala
val dnaSequence = new DNASequence("ATGGCCATTGTAATGGGCCGCTGAA")
val rnaSequence = dnaSequence.transcribe()

println(rnaSequence)  // Output: AUGGCCAUUGUAAUGGGCCGCUGAA
```

#### Example: Protein Translation
```scala
val rnaSequence = new RNASequence("AUGGCCAUUGUAAUGGGCCGCUGAA")
val proteinSequence = SequenceTranslation.translate(rnaSequence.seq)

println(proteinSequence)  // Output: MAIVMGR*
```

#### Example: Sparse Alignment
```scala
val alignment: List[List[NTSymbol]] = List(
  List(A, C, G, T, Gap),
  List(A, Gap, G, T, C)
)

val (filteredAlignment, removedColumns) = SparseAlignment.removeSparseRows(alignment, minSymbols = 2)

println(filteredAlignment)  // Output: List(List(A, C, G, T, Gap), List(A, Gap, G, T, C))
```
